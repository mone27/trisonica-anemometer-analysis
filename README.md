# Trisonica anemometer analysis
this project is done as my bachelor thesis in forestry at Universit√† della Tuscia.
The goal was to understand the feasibility of using a low cost anemometer (Trisonica mini) in Eddy Covariance applications.

This repo is quite untidy as it contains all the code used during the experiment.
If you are interested more in this project or are thinking to reuse to code feel free to contact me at simonemassaro@unitus.it
