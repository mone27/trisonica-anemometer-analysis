started working on importing data from TRS and WM

21/12/2019
you must invert the u of TRS1
v of TRS1 is perfect
w of TRS1 is not that good

23/12/2019
found correct definition of direction:
for WM and EddyPro:
u is positive when the wind flows from south to north
v is positive when the wind flows from east to west
w is positive when the wind goes up
here more info at page 7 http://gillinstruments.com/data/manuals/1561-PS-0001%20WindMaster%20Windmaster%20Pro%20Manual%20Issue%2015.pdf
For TRS (indefault setting called "otms", see page 7 https://anemoment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trisonica-Mini-User-Manual-Ap2019.pdf)
u is positive when the wind flows from north to south
v is positive when the wind flows from east to west
w is positive when the wind goes up

This mean you need to invert u component of TRS

24/12/2018
rotating u and v for TRS2 by +/- 45° seems is not working to get correct axes coordinates
cannot understand how EddyPro is calculating wind_dir
wind_dir of TRS1 is currently wrong since we u has not been inverted

proposed correction for TRS2 (check them!)
u = - rot_45°(u)
v = -w
w = rot_45°(v)

29/12/2018
generated dataset with fixed axes for TRS1 using data_prepocessing.py.
For all data from August and Septmber (~12GB) this is the time it took:
`CPU times: user 6min 51s, sys: 15.5 s, total: 7min 6s`

15/01
trying to understand how EP calculates wind dir, need to understand why it adds pi in AngularAverageNoError (line 198)
Discovered!! pi is due to the fact tha atan2 returns from -180 to 180 and adding 180 seems it is equal to converting to make `a = a % 360` and then do `180-a`.

23/01
when you need to calc the average wind_speed you cannot calc the wind_speed for each observation and then average but you need to average the components and the calc the wind_speed :)



##### 2020 version ######

### 22/07/2020

configured M506 and M507 for outputting at 10Hz and with many paramas (see screens)
analyzed last ~2 weeks of WM data and seen most of the wind from 250 degrees
Installed for tests m506 (vertical, north aligned ??) m507 (horizontal), rotated 45 degres main axis aligned with main structure (320 degrees??, problemns with compass measurements)

### 23/07/2020
First analysis of the wind of the previous night, m506 u axis has been inverted (so to match EP refence system) and then processed with EP at 5 mins. The wind speed (calulated by EP) looks comparable, the wind direction (calculated by EP) completely inverted but looking at the individual components they were completely wrong. Tried also with M507 but got pretty bad results as well, no time to investigate it more.

Reinstallation of the instruments in the field:
- WM 1 and 2 have been slightly rotated on their base to better access wind from 250°, North OFFSET: 310°
- M506 has been slightly rotated, North Offset: 0°
- M507 has been installed on a rotated support being with the bottom (of the anemometer) facing 320° N, then has been also rotated on the pipe so that is you look at the top of the anemometer the north arrow is pointingon the bottom left ( 275° clockswise from the vertical)

Compass measueremenets has been quite difficult so the anemometers can have a +/- 10 ° error in their orientation

Measurement of the distance between anemometers center

M6 risp wm1
-35 cm  E
-7  cm vert
-5 cm N

M7 risp wm1

-60 cm E
-10 cm N
-7 cm vert

Wm2 risp wm1

33 cm E
-4 cm N
0 cm vert

Configuration:
WM1 com1
WM2 com2
m506 com3
m507 com4

Succesfully connected to wifi and teamviewer
Launched scanemone for recording data

Cheking in the evening m507 on com4 started but never worked, trying to force close the scanemone process and to reboot the computer but it is not working


### 24/07/2020

Forcing rebooting computer but still issues with reading on scanemone on com4 even it was working fine with putty on serial port

Swapping the port of WM1 with m507, so configuration is:
WM1 com1
WM2 com4
m506 com3
m507 com2

cheking that all anemometers are correctly working with putty, lauching scanemone.
First good data from 13:00 

WM2 on com4 works partially for some hours saves data other times it blocked


### 25/07/2020

Anemometers are logging correctly com4 sometimes is not working.

Trying to understand angle rotation 


this function is not working (don't ask why)
```
def rotate(tens, ang, axes):
    rot_matrix = np.array([[np.cos(ang), -np.sin(ang)],
                       [np.sin(ang), np.cos(ang)]])
    return np.matmul(tens[:, axes], rot_matrix)
    
```

this is working (correctly rotating wind)

```def rotate_ang(df, ang):
    wind_dir, wind_speed = cart2pol(df.u, df.v)
    wind_dir += np.deg2rad(ang)
    return np.column_stack(pol2cart(wind_dir, wind_speed))
```

For wind dir found this website that explains it quite well http://colaweb.gmu.edu/dev/clim301/lectures/wind/wind-uv and this one https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/wind-direction-quick-reference


### 27/07/2020

Trying to use inverted v for the m506 since the direction is exactly at the opposite, but not too sure it is going to work

### 28/07/2020

Created 3d model to work understand the necessaray tranformation for m507

Updated data_preprocessing and started analysis



### 29/07/2020

eddypro_TRS_m507_full_output_2020-07-29T075333_exp -> rotation of 45 
eddypro_TRS_m507_full_output_2020-07-28T163413_exp -> rotation of -45 (seems to not be working)

with this transforms componets are still completely wrong, but overall wind speed looks promising
